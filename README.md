SQL Project on Online Book store
SQL Project on Online Book store
As part of my data analytics learning journey, I completed a hands-on SQL project analyzing an Online Bookstore using three interrelated datasets: Books.csv, Customers.csv, and Orders.csv. The project focused on designing and querying relational tables with common keys like Book_ID and Customer_ID to extract actionable business insights.

🔧 Key Tools & Skills:

SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, Group By, Order By, HAVING)

Data cleaning and normalization

Relational database design

CSV data integration

📊 Project Highlights:

Retrieved genre-specific and time-specific book and order data

Calculated total stock, total revenue, and average prices

Identified top customers, frequently ordered books, and high-spending regions

Advanced insights like:

📈 Total books sold per genre & author

💰 Highest-spending customer and revenue insights

📉 Remaining stock after order fulfillment

🏆 Top 3 most expensive books by genre

This project strengthened my ability to write efficient SQL queries, design real-world relational schemas, and derive meaningful business intelligence from raw data—skills I’m excited to apply in real-world data or business analyst roles.
